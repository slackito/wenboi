Gameboy ROM Header Info :: SephirothBCH :: v1.01 :: 2000/11/28

\\\  After the release of this document, I am temporarily   \\\
\\\  leaving the coding and emulation scene.  The last few  \\\
\\\  weeks of my life have been especially rough, mainly    \\\
\\\  brought on by the death of my uncle, Roy Colbert.      \\\
\\\  I would like to dedicate this doc, as well as any      \\\
\\\  other progs I make to his memory.                      \\\

History:
_______________
v1.01 - Added some new licensees, fixed some
        descriptions.
v1.00 - Initial release.
_______________

This information was taken and compiled from Martin Korth's
NO$GMB emulator.  Best viewed in DOS EDIT.

Every Gameboy ROM header starts off at the HEX offset 0134.

Title/Name of ROM
=================
The title of a ROM is 15 or 16 bytes long.  It seems that if the extension
of the ROM is GBC, the 16th byte denotes CGB features.  This is then confirmed
by reading a HEX value of 80 from that 16th byte.  I'm not sure of this yet,
but it seems correct.  Any title bytes that are unused are filled with NULLs.

New licensee
============
This is two bytes long.  These are two HEX values put together to make a
quasi-number value.  For example 30h and 31h translate into 01.  31h and 32h
become 12, and so on.  There are some companies also present in the licensee
section, later in this document.  Known combos are as follows, in the trans-
lated form above.
00- none                     01- nintendo           08- capcom
13- electronic arts          18- hudsonsoft         19- b-ai

SGB features
============
Only one byte long.  A HEX value of 03 says that the cartridge has added  
features for Super Gameboy.  Any other value, especially HEX 00 denotes 
a non-SGB cart.

Cartridge type
==============
One byte long.  This is one of the bigger values in the cart.  This byte
indicates which memory mapper the cartridge uses, whether it has Rumble
features, RAM, or battery features.  Valid values are as follows (in HEX):
00- ROM                      01- MBC1                02- MBC1+RAM
03- MBC1+RAM+BATTERY         05- MBC2                06- MBC2+BATTERY
08- ROM+RAM                  09- ROM+RAM+BATTERY     0B- MMM01
0C- MMM01+RAM                0D- MMM01+RAM+BATTERY   0F- MBC3+TIMER+BATTERY
10- MBC3+TIMER+RAM+BATTERY   11- MBC3                12- MBC3+RAM
13- MBC3+RAM+BATTERY         15- MBC4                16- MBC4+RAM
17- MBC4+RAM+BATTERY         19- MBC5                1A- MBC5+RAM
1B- MBC5+RAM+BATTERY         1C- MBC5+RUMBLE         1D- MBC5+RUMBLE+RAM
1E- MBC5+RUMBLE+RAM+BATTERY  FC- POCKET CAMERA       FD- Bandai TAMA5
FE- HuC3                     FF- HuC1+RAM+BATTERY
*** The Bandai TAMA5 mapper was designed specifically for Tamagotchi. ***

ROM size
========
One byte long, fairly simple.  ROM sizes range from 32K to 4MB.  Valid HEX
values are as follows:
00- 32k         01- 64k         02- 128k        03- 256k        04- 512k
05- 1024k       06- 2048k       07- 4096k

Save RAM size
=============
One byte also, self-explanitory.  Sizes range from no RAM, to 32K.  The most
common ones used are 8k and 32k.  HEX values:
00- 0k          01- 2k          02- 8k          03- 32k

Country code
============
Once again, this is only one byte long.  Valid HEX values are 00- Japan and
01- Non-Japan.

Licensee
========
One byte long, this makes up the bulk of the entire document.  Some of the
names are truncated (*), because they are too long for NO$GMB to display.  
Anyone who has the full names of the truncated licensees please email me, and 
you will get credit for them.  Here are all of the valid HEX values I found:
00- none               01- nintendo           08- capcom
09- hot-b              0A- jaleco             0B- coconuts

Header Check
============
One byte long.  Not sure how this value is attained or checked.  Email me if
you know, you'll get credit.

Global Check
============
Two bytes long.  Perhaps this is a checksum of the entire rom.  It might not,
since it is only a 16-bit value.  Email me if you know.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so ends this document.  If you have anything to add, or know of an error,
email me at SephirothBCH@theglobe.com.  The next version of this document will
have explanations of the global and header check, and information on mappers
such as MBC1 and MBC2.  Thanks for reading!
